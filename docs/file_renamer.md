## **Project documentation**

We have been creating a program that is able to detect and modify shapes and text on images. This repository is a container of all the Python scripts that have been used for the above mentioned OpenCV project by MEGALOTIS-SAPPHIRE project team.<br/>

List of available scripts, their definitions, and short descriptions:


- rename file

 `renamer(sys.argv[1])`<br/>

The function can be executed in command line. It takes one arguement as input that is the absolute path of images which are intended to rename. The format of the filename and extension of the first file is going to be yyy1.xxx. In order to set the desired filename the user has to modify line 5 (filename) and line 11 (extension). <br/>
